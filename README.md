commandlinefu-cli
=================

A little CLI command to work with the [commandlinefu.com](http://www.commandlinefu.com) website.

The proposed workflow at the moment is:
* Launch the command by typing `fu` or `fu search query` 
* Get a little interactive list of commands directly from commandlinefu.com
* Open the desired command in an `$EDITOR` (such as vi, emacs or nano)
* The edited command is then ready to be copied or ran
* ...
* Profit!

*Warning: the current version in `master` is NOT usable yet. However, if you like the concept, and would like to help, shoot me a line by email: dannypovolotski@gmail.com*
